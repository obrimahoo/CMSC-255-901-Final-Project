Collaborators: Eeshan Singh, Adrian Vagberg, Mel Sofronio

## Program Description
This program was created by a team of students at Virginia Commonwealth University.	
We collaborated to design and create a program that finds the distance between two of the 10 most populous US cities, or between geographic coordinates.
This program utilizes JavaFX to create a GUI, allowing for users to select the city/coordinate to measure from via dropdown menu, and upon input, outputs a map drawing the line between coordinates.

## Technologies
